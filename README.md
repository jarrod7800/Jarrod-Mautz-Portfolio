# Jarrod-Mautz-Portfolio
This is my ongoing Data Science and Quant Portfolio!

# [Project 1: Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/jarrod7800/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis/sentiment_models.ipynb)
- Utilized object oriented programing and the Tweepy API to scrape recent tweets and other data related to 'Bitcoin'.
- Manually analyze tweets for sentiment and assign a label (manually to reduce redundancy).
- Perfomed data preprocessing to clean each tweet. 
- Balance dataset using SMOTE and then fit various classification models to text.
- Identify top two performing models.

# [Project 2: LSTM Stock Price Model vs Naive Model: Project Overview](https://github.com/jarrod7800/Stock-Projects/blob/master/Stock%20LSTM/Stock_Prediction_LSTM.ipynb)
- Explore stock price prediction possibilities and create model to try and beat naive forecast.
- Three different financial APIs were utilized to access historic economic data, OHLC data, and economic indicators.
- Engineered and preprocessed time series features into 3D sequential data for LSTM Input.
- Use Keras to build LSTM model fitted on historical data from five different consumer goods companies. 
- Create various visualizations to compare predicted prices to naive model.
